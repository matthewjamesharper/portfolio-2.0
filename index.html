     <h3> About Me: </h3>
     <p>  
     My career history may seem varied, but I believe that it has made me an ideal canditate for the software engineering program that Thinkful offers. 
     </p> 
     <p> 
     3.5 years ago, I made a huge career change when I decided to leave my position as a chocolate maker at America's oldest confectionery in search of something more. 
      </p> 
     <p> 
      I found that next something when I began my next career in the customer service department at Comoto - a growing  online retailer specializing in the sale of motorcycle parts, apparel, and accessories. 
      After leveling up in my current department, I've decided that it's time to make another similar change, but within the company that has been my home for the last several years.  
      </p> 
     <p>
     Now, I intend to bring my commitment to hard work in the service of others and penchant for acquiring specialty knowledge to a new facet of the same industry.
